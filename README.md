# My first time experimenting with SVG animations
I created my own SVG images using Adobe Illustrator and explored how I can combine them into an animated sequence.

# What is this project ?
I wanted to create an open animated sequence for a fake car ecommerce website. I did this because I believe when used in the right manner, animations can create a better user experience for users.
